compass-inline-sprites
======================

Just a simple wrapper to make your sprites map a base64 string within your CSS instead of a reference to local files. Feel free to spread around the the various steps within screen.scss if you use a SMACSS-style file structure. Make sure you notice the selector grouping happening in the rendered screen.css. See comments in screen.scss for guidance. Note that this uses the awesome "inline-sprite" feature in the most recent Compass.
